Heap Sort in Perl 6

Heap Sort. The binary heap data structures is an array that can be viewed as a complete binary tree. Each node of the binary tree corresponds to an element of the array. The array is completely filled on all levels except possibly lowest. We represent heaps in level order, going from left to right.
